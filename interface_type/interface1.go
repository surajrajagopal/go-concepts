/*
Interface - In Go, an interface is a set of method signatures. When a type provides definition for all the methods in the interface,
it is said to implement the interface.

Empty interface - An interface that has zero methods is called an empty interface.
- any type can be passed to empty interface

Implementing multiple interfaces - A type can implement more than one interface

Embedding interfaces - Although go does not offer inheritance, it is possible to create a new interfaces by embedding other interfaces.

Zero value of Interface - . A nil interface has both its underlying value and as well as concrete type as nil.
